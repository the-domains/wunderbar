"The software learned its rudimentary common sense by being shown how to answer questions about a simple text in which characters do things in a series of rooms, such as "Fred moved to the bedroom and Joe went to the kitchen." But LeCun wants to expose the software to texts that are far better at capturing the complexity of life and the things a virtual assistant might need to do. A virtual concierge called Moneypenny that Facebook is expected to release could be one source of that data. The assistant is said to be powered by a team of human operators who will help people do things like make restaurant reservations. LeCun's team could have a memory network watch over Moneypenny's shoulder before eventually letting it learn by interacting with humans for itself."
